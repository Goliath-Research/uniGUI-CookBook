Tax Code Maintenance
WTC 5/17/97

How it works:
1) User creates one or more TAX ELEMENTS. Can include an element code, a description and a rate for the particular element. Should create as many as needed to account for all individual types of accounts he must track. Can include (at this point) a GL account number.

2) User creates a TAX CODE, and links in as many elements as necessary to make up the whole code. 

3) Any single Element may be used multiple times in any Tax Code, but only once within the Tax Code.

What needs to be done:

1) We have a table called TblTaxCodeLink. It consists of only two columns: TaxCode_ID and TaxElement_ID. We need to create the display so that the DBGrid shows the Element, Description and Rate. 

2) Need to create a calculated value (and store it) of the total tax elements per tax Code. The value is stored in tblTaxCode, but cannot be directly edited by the end user.

Example:
TaxCode: LA County
	Tax Elements:
		Calif State Tax - 5.0%
		LA County Tax   - .75%
		Transportation  - .5
		Municipal Bond  - .25
		City Tax        - .5
 Total Tax Rate: 7.0% (Calculated from above)	     

3) Tie in the GL account number. I see a simple pulldown comboBox right in the grid. Need to add the account table to the DM.

How to link one or more Tax Elements to a Tax code
1) User creates a tax code
2) moves to lower grid and adds a tax element by pressing plus (+) on local dbnavigator, or we can add a right mouse popup thing.
3) Selects element from list
4) bottom grid re-displays selection
5) Same concept to remove an element (-).
